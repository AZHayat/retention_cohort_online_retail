# 🛒 Online Retail Data Analysis - Retention Cohort Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer retention** using cohort analysis from an **Online Retail Dataset**. The goal is to uncover customer behavior patterns over time, understand the retention rates, and provide insights that can guide business strategies for customer retention.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comes from a real-world online retail transaction record. It includes the sales transactions occurring between **2010 and 2011**, and consists of:
- order_id 
- product_code 
- product_name 
- quantity 
- order_date 
- price
- customer_id

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
For this project, the following tools and libraries were used:
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: To clean and preprocess the data
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: As the development environment

## 📈 Key Analysis: Retention Cohort
The core focus of this analysis is to build a **cohort analysis** to track customer retention over a period of time:
- **Cohorts**: Customers are grouped by their first purchase month.
- **Retention**: We analyze how many of the customers from each cohort return and make additional purchases over the following months.
- **Insights**: This helps identify patterns in customer loyalty and retention rates, which can be used to improve business strategies.

## 📉 Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations, such as:
- **Cohort Heatmap**: Visual representation of customer retention over time.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Retention Rate**: On average, the retention rate declines over time, but certain cohorts show higher loyalty.
- **Seasonality**: Certain months have a spike in new customer acquisition, followed by a higher-than-average retention rate.
